Notes 
-----------
This plugin is forked from https://github.com/ProThoughts/q2a-custom-404-page by Prothoughts.com . Both serves the same purpose . I have added some more fretures like search box , costum css and some code enhancements . So make sure you are using any one but not both . If you have installed both then it may not work as expected .
